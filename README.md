# Warm the Earth

Jeffery has a problem -- it's waaaaaay too cold! Help heat him (as well as the entire Earth) with tools, gadgets, stocks, politics, potato farming, gambling, and more!

## Things to note before playing

- Not all content is visible at the start. Keep playing and it'll eventually reveal itself
- There are admin commands to give yourself ENERGY, POWER and POTATOES.
- Some upgrades are locked behind the first ascension.
- Yes Jeffery is a stickman. I know I could make an actual art asset for him but frankly it's objectively funnier if I don't.
